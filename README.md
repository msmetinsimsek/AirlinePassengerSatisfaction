In this process, we worked on an aviation project that included approximately 130,000 observations, and it was a study in which we estimated the satisfaction level of people traveling by plane according to various surveys.

A project that deals with the preparation of the data set, the identification of outliers and missing observations, the creation of new variables, and the evaluation of the results and model creation by testing various machine learning models on the data set throughout the study.
